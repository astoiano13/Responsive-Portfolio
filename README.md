# Responsive-Portfolio

This homework assignment was our second, requiring us to create the base of our own portfolio, as well as test our ability to create a semi-responsive website on multiple different sizes of screens using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I utilized bootstrap mainly to construct this website, as well as and exteral CSS link to style my containers, etc. I made sure to follow the grid and row layouts to make sure everything fit properly on my site when the browser was resized.
